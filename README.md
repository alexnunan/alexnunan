### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate of Launch Academy, a programming bootcamp and apprenticeship. In my 18 weeks at LA, I developed a variety of programming skills, including React.js, CSS, HTML, PostgreSQL, Object Oriented Programming and much more. Additionally, I built a full stack web application in a team of four, and began developing my own individual project, TuneTangle. I am currently looking for junior developer roles and am excited to further develop my skills.
